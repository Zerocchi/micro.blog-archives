But even ngIRCd is pretty tricky to set up the first time. Making it run with Systemd is just very annoying, and it failed to spawn so many times it got me frustrated. Eventually after a few hours I managed to get it to spin together with additional settings like user cloak to hide the IP address attached as hostname.

I decided to go with <a href=\"https://atheme.dev/\">Atheme</a> because it looks simple and modern enough, although not as popular as Anope.

Had I sit down, sip some tea, and went through the docs properly, I&rsquo;ll be done in few minutes. With some luck and patience, the services got through and connected to my server.

I finished them up by getting an IRC bot because what&rsquo;s IRC without all those bots. After few searches I decided on using <a href=\"https://limnoria.net/\">Limnoria</a>, a successor to Supybot. I also set up The Lounge web client so anyone (my friends) without desktop client can join the server easily. The whole process was quite frustrating and fun at the same time and I learnt a lot along the way. Still feel like wanting to try writing IRC bot from scratch so I would have extra goodies for my small server.</p>\n<p>Where is the server, you ask?
